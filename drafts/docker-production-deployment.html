        <p>I'm a bit hesitant to write this blog post because the amount of discussion
about docker production deployment is fucking overwhelming.</p>
<p>But I want to (attempt to) get it clear in my head so I'm going to do it anyway.</p>
<p>So I'll start with a story.</p>
<p>At my place of work we had several seprate production deployments of our
(slightly different for each) app. </p>
<p>Unfortunately with a quick growing company and clients to please our code base 
had become something of a (big ball of
mud)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud]. i</p>
<p>The code itself had the right idea, various different bits of the app had their 
own git repos. The problem was that most git repos depended upon each other.</p>
<p>Hence our build process was a single job that built our entire code base in
one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The individual applications themselves were actually fine. For the most part
each application that comprised our whole site could happily run independently
on a server (just as long as even the smallest app had the entire code base sat
with it on the server).</p>
<p>We had the right idea we'd just missed some stuff along the way.</p>
<p>Then (due, probably wholly, to the fact that management consists of developers)
the company took the decision to fix it all.</p>
<p>This involved moving to a Service Oriented Architecture. The idea being that
seperate parts of our code could be built independently and run independently.
Woohoo.</p>
<p>With this came the decision to sort out our production (and with that, test and
dev) environments. As it stood we were definitely running (Pets, not
Cattle)[http://it20.info/2012/12/vcloud-openstack-pets-and-cattle/]. In fairness
our servers were fairly uniform, but once a production server was up it was up.
Also (to make supporting the servers simple) each server had a function: web,
admin, api and so on.</p>
<p>To do this, first we want the power to say:</p>
<h1>Here are some applications: web, admin, api, rabbitmq, redis, couchbase. They</h1>
<p>must be running, always.</p>
<p>We also need to be able to say:</p>
<h1>Api needs to know about rabbitmq, web, admin and api need to talk to</h1>
<p>couchbase. api needs to talk to web.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and </p>
<h1>Our clients running a promotion, make web and api faster (preferably by</h1>
<p>running them on multiple servers)</p>
<p>This wasn't really complicated enough for us so we decided we also wanted to be
able to say </p>
<h1>I've got this update for web but it's a big change. Run it somewhere but only</h1>
<p>let 10% of our end users see it</p>
<p>And definitely</p>
<h1>Oh crap, that release has broken everything. Take it down, take it down now!</h1>
<p>And of course</p>
<h1>I want this fix to go up, everywhere, now. 10 times a day.</h1>
<p>To deal with how this actually looks on the server and after looking at what 
everyone else was doing there only seemed to be one option: Linux Containers!</p>
<p>And if you look in to linux containers and tooling around them there's another
clear option: Docker!</p>
<p>So that's the end of that then. Throw some containers at our problems, sorted.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley that isn't even the beginning of it. </p>
