  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Super low budget VPS servers make an ideal home for your own honeypot, this
post takes you through setting up a feature packed honeypot on a TinyVZ VPS.</em></p>
<p>I'm always on the look out for a cheap place to a host a honeypot which is why
I was pretty intrigued when I came accross a few companies offering $15
 <strong>per year</strong> virtual private servers.</p>
<p>This offer does seem to good to be true - and I don't plan on hosting anything
important on my VPS - but I've been running one with <a href="http://tinyvz.com">TinyVZ</a>
for 3 months now and had no problems to speak of.</p>
<p>So, here's a quick guide to setting up your own $15 honeypot - though please
don't treat this as a glowing endorsement of super cheap VPSs, when I paid my
$15 I treated it more as placing a bet than purchasing a service.</p>
<p>I have chosen <a href="http://tinyvz.com/">TinyVZ</a> as the host for this guide, you can
almost certainly do this on other
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=$15%20a%20year%20vps%20host">similarly cheap hosts</a>.
Because this guide uses my
<a href="/2013/01/automatic-honeypot-setup-script/">honeypot setup script</a>
most of it revolves around navigating TinyVZ's control panel. I am not
affiliated with TinyVZ.</p>
<p>TinyVZ have confirmed that they are happy for their customers to run honeypots.</p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Server Setup (TinyVZ Specific)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sign up for a <a href="http://tinyvz.com/">TinyVZ</a> account (<em>this can take up to <strong>3
days</strong></em>)</li>
<li>You will eventually receive a "New Server Information" email.</li>
<li>Login to the <a href="https://my.ramhost.us/v2/vps/cp/">control panel</a> with the details
provided.</li>
<li>Click "Reload OS"</li>
<li>Choose <strong>ubuntu-12.04-x86</strong> and push "Reload with selected OS"</li>
<li>Once that's done go back to "Main Menu"</li>
<li>Now copy the I.P. address of "Host Machine" and connect via SSH to this address</li>
<li>When prompted enter username "vz" and password "vz"</li>
<li>Now for "RAMCP Username" and "RAMCP Password" enter the username and password
provided in the welcome email</li>
<li>You should now be logged in as root</li>
<li>Set a password with <code>passwd</code></li>
<li>Install sudo:
<code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install sudo</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Install (Ubuntu)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now run the following: <code>wget -q
https://raw.github.com/andrewmichaelsmith/honeypot-setup-script/master/setup.bash
-O /tmp/setup.bash &amp;&amp; bash /tmp/setup.bash</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>Tada</strong> - you should now have a full <a href="https://code.google.com/p/kippo/">Kippo</a>
and <a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/">Dionaea</a> install. You can monitor
<code>/var/kippo</code> and <code>/var/dionaea</code> for logs and binaries.</p>
<p><strong>Security Considerations</strong>
The default setup you are left with on this server is iffy at best. You should
not really be logging in as root, I would advise at the very least following
<a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/05/openssh-options/">this guide on securing SSH</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just finished work on the first version of my <a href="https://github.com/andrewmichaelsmith/honeypot-setup-script/">automatic honeypot setup
script</a>. This
script will turn a vanilla install of Ubuntu 12.04 into a fully functioning
honeypot in under 3 minutes.</p>
<p>I have two main issues that I have encountered when playing around with honeypot
software.</p>
<p>Firstly, you often won't find out that there are problems with your
configuration until an attacker hits. And this can sometimes take hours.
Nothing is more frustrating than coming back to a honeypot after a week to find
a log file full of <code>Access Denied</code> messages.</p>
<p>Secondly, honeypot software is designed with technical users in mind. Installing
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache Web Server</a> is a matter of
<code>apt-get install apache2</code>, it will start on system start up and come with helpful
defaults. Whereas if you want to install <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kippo/">kippo</a>, you
need to check out the subversion repository and it certainly won't set itself up
to run on startup.</p>
<p>This script is my solution to these problems: <a href="https://github.com/andrewmichaelsmith/honeypot-setup-script/">https://github.com/andrewmichaelsmith/honeypot-setup-script/</a></p>
<p>Running the script will install the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dionaea.carnivore.it/">Dionaea</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/kippo/">Kippo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/#/">p0f</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these services will:</p>
<ul>
<li>run straight out of the box with no additional configuration</li>
<li>start on system start up and log to <code>/var/log</code></li>
<li>have useful and secure defaults</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be prompted for exactly one piece of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the network interface you want these services to run on</li>
</ul>
<p>This the first release and testing has been limited to Ubuntu 12.04. This script
does all sorts of things as a super user, so please, for now, only run it on a
clean install.</p>
<p>Feature requests, bug reports and pull requests are encouraged on <a href="https://github.com/andrewmichaelsmith/honeypot-setup-script/">the Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any other queries, please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>

        <a href="./2012/07/multiple-ips-for-ec2-honeypots/">Multiple IPs for EC2 Instances</a>
      </h1>
      <p class="meta"><time datetime="2012-07-19T14:14:00+01:00" pubdate>Thu 19 July 2012</time></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Amazon recently announced an increase in their IP Address limits for single EC2 instances. At first glance this looks like big news for anyone who runs a honeypot on EC2. My research has found that it's not quite as good as it sounds but there are definite benefits for anyone with a little cash to spend.</em></p>
<p>Up until recently it has not been possible to have more than 1 IP Address associated with your EC2 instance*. As someone who runs a Dionaea Honeypot on EC2 I have been looking for a way to get multiple IP addresses pointed at my instance for a while now.</p>
<p>Which is why I was quite excited when Amazon <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/06/multiple-ip-addresses-for-amazon-ec2-instances-in-amazon-vpc/">announced</a> that they would now support <strong>up to 240 IP Addresses</strong> per single EC2 instance. That figure actually refers to private IPs, but in AWS land a private IP can have a public IP pointed at it. So this sounds like big news for anyone running a honeypot on an EC2 instance; more IPs means more interesting honeypot data. 240 IPs means a crap load of interesting honeypot data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not quite as simple as that. The 240 IP limit only applies to the rather expensive High-Memory Quadruple Extra Large ($1317.60 a month) instance. Smaller instances have smaller limits. The smaller amounts are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Micro: -</li>
<li>Small: 8</li>
<li>Medium: 12</li>
<li>Large: 30</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html">source</a></p>
<p>As you can see that means that anyone hoping to get multiple IPs on their free tier micro instance are out of luck.</p>
<p>For those thinking that 30 IPs is not too bad and they may splash out on a large, there's a further limitation from Amazon. They limit EC2 users to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/eip_limit_request/">5 IP Addresses per account</a>. Fortunately, you can <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/eip_limit_request/">request an increase</a>, which is exactly what I did. I found that there wasn't a need for too much detail, my e-mail looked something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am looking to increase my IP limit, please, I need a higher amount for the security  research that I use my EC2 instances for.
Ideally I would like 240 but will be grateful for a smaller amount if that isn't possible.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazon raised my limit to <strong>20 IP addresses</strong>. In this day and age to IPv4 exhaustion I suppose 20 is not to be sniffed at but it could be better, maybe if I made a stronger case in the future (or had more paid instances..) I would get more but it's hard to tell.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Amazon's recent limit increase is only big news for big spenders. It's not possible to just grab 240 IP and point them at your free tier micro instance. If all you want is a few more IPs then it's probably more cost effective to <a href="http://andrewmichaelsmith.com/2010/10/honeypot-hosting/">grab a budget VPS</a>.</p>
<p>However, if you want the flexibility of EC2 then this may be worthwile. The great thing about EC2 is the flexibility. You can grab those IPs and release them as you like. So if there was some particularly interesting vulnerability you wanted to emulate, you could quickly spin up a 20 IP instance, run it for a few days and then spin it back down. Then you could release the data publicly without any worry about compromising your honeypot's anonymity.</p>
<p>I intend to follow up this post with a quick step by step guide on setting up a 20 IP Dionaea honeypot.</p>
<p>* <em>I believe that strictly speaking the limit is 2 but I looked in to this once and it requires all sorts of faffing with things like load balancers which I deemed to not be worth the effort.</em></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a new user to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/">GWT</a> I spent quite some time trying to add a Twitter
Tweet button and Facebook Like button to a GWT project. After extensive searching I didn't find a
useful answer.</p>
<p>The issue I was having was that I would include the JavaScript and
the HTML provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/about/resources/buttons">Twitter</a>
and <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like/">Facebook</a>
but my buttons weren't being rendered.</p>
<p>I had the JavaScript includes in my <code>index.jsp</code> and had created a UIBinder <code>.swt.xml</code> with the HTML code but when I launched my app it was just blank.</p>
<p>The solution was to make a call to the Twitter and Facebook JavaScript functions once the <code>Composite</code> had loaded.</p>
<p>This is achieved by over-riding the <code>Composite</code>'s <code>onLoad</code> method and calling the rendering functions like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="x">@Override protected void onLoad() </span><span class="err">{</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x"> showSocialButtons();</span>
<span class="x"> super.onLoad();</span>
<span class="x">}</span>

<span class="x">private static native String showSocialButtons() /*-</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="x"></span>
<span class="x"> </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">wnd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">twttr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">widgets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">load</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="x">; //Render twitter button</span>
<span class="x"> </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">wnd</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">FB</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">XFBML</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">parse</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="x">;     //Render facebook button</span>
<span class="x">}-*/;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And this meant that my social buttons were being rendered properly.</p></div>
